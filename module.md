## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Variables

Expressions

Conditionals

Loops

Functions

Classes

Data structure from Java Collection Framework

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
- Youtube, ChatGPT, Google

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
- To make the Weather Forecast App with Java, I'll learn step by step. First, I'll understand the basics of Java like variables and how to control the flow of a program. Then, I'll learn about objects and how they help organize code better. After that, I'll dive into using Java to connect with other services, like weather websites. Next, I'll figure out how to make the app look good and easy to use, using tools for making buttons and text boxes. Once the app looks good, I'll make sure it works well by testing it and fixing any problems. Lastly, I'll write down how everything works so others can understand it too. By following these steps, I'll be able to create a simple and helpful Weather Forecast App.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
- Weather Forecast App
4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
- Days : Monday to Sunday, Times : 16:00 - 17:00, Locations : MC building, STC

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
- To handle problems, I'll pick a good weather website and prepare for when it might not work. If I face any difficulties with managing time, I'll use simple tricks to stay on track and finish tasks on time. My goal is to make a Weather Forecast App that's simple and helpful for users.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|  May 1   |  16:00   |  IM    |Install java and intellij program           |  1 hour     |
|  May 2   |  18:00   |  IM    |Study about Java                            |  2 hours    |
